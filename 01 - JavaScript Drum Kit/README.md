# JavaScript Drum Kit

This is the first project in Wes Bos' 30-day JavaScript coding challenge. 

## New Elements

The ```<kbd>``` element "represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device." ( [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd))

## Keycodes

Each key on your computer keyboard has an associated code necessary for instructions related to its pressing. Wes has made [a handy website](http://keycode.info/) that displays keycode information for any key pressed.

## ```data-key```

```data-``` attributes were designed to better standardize custom attributes. ```data-key``` is this project's custom attribute to associate the ```.wav``` files with elements.

## ```transitionend``` Events

This event 'listens' for a transition to have finished before performing a given function
